**Moro! / Hi!**

I'm Matias, a student of mathematics at Tampere University with a side focus on computer science and programming.

I've been messing around with computers since I was little and over the years I've coded some cool projects in C++, Java and Python. Contributing to open-source projects has also gotten me familiarized with Git, so I know both the technical side of collaborating here as well as whose arms I have to twist to get my PRs merged. :D
